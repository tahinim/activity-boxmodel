            <h1> Apple Nano Ipod</h1>
            <p> About the size of a credit card and just 5.4 mm thin - <em>iPod nano</em> is the thinnest iPod ever made. The 2.5-inch Multi-Touch display is nearly twice as big as the display on the previous iPod nano, so you can see more of the music, photos, and videos you love. Buttons let you quickly play, pause, change songs, or adjust the volume. The smooth anodized aluminum design makes iPod nano feel as good as it sounds. And iPod nano wouldn't be iPod nano without gorgeous, hard-to-choose-from colors</p>

            <p><strong>How to get your groove on</strong></p>
        
        <p>Tap to play your favorite songs. Or entire albums.
Or everything by one artist. You can even browse by genres or composers. Flip through your music: Album art looks great on the bigger screen. Or to keep things fresh, give iPod nano a shake and it shuffles to a different song in your music library.</p>

<p><strong> Genius.Your own personal DJ</strong></p>

<p>Say you're listening to a song you love and you want to stay in the mood. Just tap Genius. It finds other songs on iPod nano that go great together and makes a Genius playlist for you. For more song combinations you wouldn't have thought of yourself, create Genius Mixes in iTunes and sync the ones you like to iPod nano. Then tap Genius Mixes and rediscover songs you haven't heard in a while - or find music you forgot you even had.</p>
